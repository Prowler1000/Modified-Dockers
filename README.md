# Modified Dockers
A poorly named reposity to host a custom Dockerfiles from existing images to fine-tune functionality for my use. (Renamed repository to allow Dockerfiles for multiple services). 

# Nextcloud
Moved from Nextcloud being hosted on a VPS to a self-hosted docker and found there were some extra packages I needed.
