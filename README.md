# Modified Dockers
A poorly named reposity to host a custom Dockerfiles from existing images to fine-tune functionality for my use. (Renamed repository to allow Dockerfiles for multiple services). 

# Nextcloud
Nextcloud with ffmpeg (maybe the base repo has it now, I haven't looked in a while)
Moved from Nextcloud being hosted on a VPS to a self-hosted docker and found there were some extra packages I needed.

# VSCode-Server (Abandoned for now)
Having an underpowered device can make development on the go a pain. Set this up to fix that, still plenty of issues with the setup though.

# Nginx
Nginx built from source with http3 support.

I wanted to switch away from Nginx Proxy Manager and wanted to add http3 support for my self hosted services. Figured this was a decent project to learn a bit more about Dockerfiles (and Github Actions actually). Has the benefit of allowing me to add whatever services I want.
