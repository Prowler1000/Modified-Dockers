# VSCode-Server
## WARNING:
The user running the VSCode CLI in the docker is root. This was done as I was having difficulties getting the docker to play nicely on unraid.
This obviously raises security concerns and, as such, this should *NOT* be used for large projects or projects where security, well, is a conern.
I need this Docker to allow me to do my course work on mobile but less powerful devices and as such, am less concerned about security.

I do fully intend on fixing this later, however I need to take the time to actually understand why Unraid is different instead of throwing things
at the wall and hoping they work.
